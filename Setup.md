# Notebooks
For the Jupyter notebooks, navigate to the particular notebook e.g. [ImageFormat notebook](https://github.com/ome/EMBL-EBI-imaging-course-04-2025/blob/main/ImageFormat.ipynb) and click on the ``Colab`` badge.

Note that the [Bio-Formats notebook](https://github.com/ome/EMBL-EBI-imaging-course-04-2025/blob/main/BioFormats.ipynb) cannot be run in Colab, instead, read the text and execute on the command line as appropriate.

# Install Python Virtual Environment (venv)
For some exercises, installation of ``venv`` is necessary.

Create the new environment:
```
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Activate it:
```
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
```

Install packages into the VM
```
pip install ....
```
